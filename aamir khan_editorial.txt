Aamir Khan’s right to speak</p></p>The Abrogation Of The Special Status Of Jammu , Kashmir , To The Landmark Ayodhya Verdict , Proved To Be An Eventful Year. , </p></p>In the Bharatiya Janata Party Parivar’s revised reckoner, actor >Aamir Khan is now a villain giving India a bad name. It happened >the day he joined forces with writers, actors and scientists and re-opened the debate on intolerance in the country by voicing his own concern and his wife’s anxiety and thoughts, perhaps fleeting, of relocating elsewhere. It was not long before that the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre had made him the brand ambassador of >Swachh Bharat while continuing with him as the face of Incredible India. The underlying subtext to the criticism being heaped on Khan is that while the Narendra Modi government has been gracious to the actor, known for his contrarian positions taken in the past, Khan has been churlish, ungrateful and unmindful of the gestures made to him. The criticism of Khan, therefore, falls into an all-too-predictable pattern. If the writers who returned their awards were lampooned by fellow-writers for being unpatriotic, anti-national and motivated, Khan has been at the receiving end of his fellow-actors, some of whom have been vocal supporters of the current political leadership. In the clamour, Khan’s concerns are typically given short shrift, particularly his comment that it is important to have a sense of security and justice, essential underpinnings of any democratic society. It is the perceived lack of both that prompted writers/scientists/artists and filmmakers to question the government and return their national awards in protest. Like them, Khan too has underlined the importance of both for the political leadership — in particular, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, by reminding him that he is the elected leader of the people of the country and must connect with their concerns.

In many ways, the Prime Minister’s silence continues to cause anxiety among civil society members, particularly in the minority community. Mr. Modi’s comments on the minority community during the Bihar campaign, without directly referring to them, have led to significant disquiet. The political leadership in the Central government and in the BJP remains resistant to addressing these anxieties by taking questions, reinforcing apprehensions. There is also something deeply disturbing in the suggestion of the BJP’s ally, the Shiv Sena, that >Aamir Khan be sent to Pakistan , for Khan is a Muslim, and the coding in the formulation is not intended to be subtle. Bollywood, of which Khan is an integral part, has never traded on religious identities. The actor has been forced to clarify that >neither he nor his wife has any intention of leaving India . Forcing citizens to abjectly clarify their patriotism is not the sign of a liberal democracy. Every Indian must have the right to critique her country. When fellow-citizens receive the critique as a sign of betrayal, it is a sign of illiberalism. When those fellow-Indians happen to be connected to power, directly or politically, democracy is truly in trouble.</p></p></p></p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bollywood has come under the scanner of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s mouthpiece Panchjanya with the cover story of its latest edition making a frontal attack on certain film stars, including Aamir Khan, as not being nationalist enough.

Magazine editor Hitesh Shankar told The Hindu that while it was true that Mr. Khan had made films such as Lagaan, Sarfarosh and 1857: The Rising, his current actions were not of the nationalist hue.

“The meeting between Aamir Khan and Turkey’s first lady Mrs Erdogan hurt feelings in India as the Erdogan government has been opposing India’s legitimate actions in Jammu and Kashmir. We also wanted to decode why Aamir Khan was so popular in China compared with other Indian film stars, why Dangal did better there than Sultan (starring Salman Khan) which had almost the same content. Aamir Khan also endorses particular Chinese brands, and no one flourishes in China till the Chinese state decides to promote them,” Mr. Shankar said.

‘Lost tradition’

The title of the write-up, Dragon Ka Pyara Khan (“The Khan beloved of the dragon”), is self-explanatory and lauds stars like Akshay Kumar, Kangana Ranaut and Ajay Devgn for continuing the “lost” tradition of making films based on nationalist sentiments or brave deeds of the armed forces.

“After Indian and Chinese forces faced off in Galwan Valley, film star Ajay Devgn announced a film on the incident. This was enough for a few English-speaking intellectuals on Twitter to mockingly state that after Akshay Kumar, the bug of nationalism seems to have bitten Devgn. It seems Devgn’s move sparked some vested interests,” the piece says.

Streaming platforms have been lauded for a number of web series on issues of “nationalism” such as the Manoj Bajpayee-starrer The Family Man that the same magazine criticised when it first came out, on the grounds that some dialogues indicated a sympathetic view of the origins of terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir.

The criticism of Mr. Khan also mentions his comments at a journalism award function a few years ago where he spoke of growing intolerance in India and fears for his family’s safety. At that time too his remarks had created a controversy and Sangh Parivar outfits had termed them as politically motivated.</p></p></p></p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

</p></p>Aamir Khan's Comment</p></p>Sentinel Digital Desk , </p></p>Aamir Khan's Comment

Amir khan the renowned actor and ambassador of the Government’s Tourism Ministry expressed his deep thoughts regarding “Intolerance” and he expressed that India is no more a safe place for Muslims. His intention was to declare India as a pro-Hindu country. He said that he and his wife at one time had thought of leaving this country for ever as cases of intolerance, especially intolerance against the Muslim community, were increasing day by day. It is well noticed that many Hindu organisations have sprouted while the BJP came to power, but they constitutes not the BJP. The BJP never practises intolerance. It is a conspiracy of the opponents, especially the dystic and feudalistic Congress party.

Actors like Shahrukh Khan, Amir Khan or Salman Khan are earning crores from at least 80 per cent of Hindu film-goers who have made them super heroes. Did any Hindu object to Shahrukh Khan’s marriage with Gauri, a Hindu girl? Did Amir face any Hindu fatwa on his marriage day? Did Amir face any trial from Hindus while depicting meaninglessness of Hindu Gods and Deities in “PK”? Had Amir depicted the Quran as the “Satanic Verses”, the Muslim clerics would have killed him. Film stars like Amir Khan sometimes spill venom against India and the 80 per cent Hindu people. They should be careful in commenting on sensitive issues like “Intolerance” and comment more on everyday killings of innocents and army jawans by the Pakistani security forces and Pakistan provoked terrorists. Since Islamic terrorists are creating havoc in the world and in the eventuality of another World War, the onus will be on Muslims and not on Hindus. Hindus are a more open lot and more forgiving!

</p></p>RSS mouthpiece accuses Aamir Khan of colluding against India after Turkish First Lady meeting</p></p>Neelam Pandey , </p></p>Text Size: A- A+

New Delhi: Days after actor Aamir Khan met Turkish First Lady Emine Erdogan, RSS mouthpiece Panchjanya has accused him of colluding with anti-India forces, with specific reference to China and Turkey.

The latest issue of the weekly magazine focusses on Bollywood, and one of the articles accuses Aamir Khan of being friendly with countries that are considered India’s enemies, while going on to praise actors like Ajay Devgn and Kangana Ranaut for doing “nationalistic” films.

“On one hand, there are some stars and filmmakers including Akshay Kumar, Ajay Devgn, John Abraham and Kangana Ranaut for whom making or acting in a film full of nationalism and patriotism is like showing their loyalty to the country. On the other hand is an actor like Aamir Khan, who does not see any harm in forging friendships with those that are considered enemies of India,” states the article, titled ‘Dragon ka pyara Khan’ (The Khan loved by the Dragon).

The article asks when the audience spends money on a ticket, “not giving a thought” to the religion of the actor, but the same star becomes a puppet of an enemy nation for a “few bucks” and accepts its invitation “shamelessly”, should the audience not feel cheated?

Aamir Khan met First Lady Erdogan on 15 August, and two days later, the Vishva Hindu Parishad had hit out at him, saying the “love of some individuals and actors for anti-India forces has been increasing”.

‘Aamir cares two hoots about sentiments of countrymen’

The article goes on to state that at a time when India is fighting the Covid-19 pandemic unitedly, Aamir Khan is busy meeting the First Lady of Turkey in relation to shooting for his film, and “bending over backwards” in front of her.

It further argues that it is important to understand the manner in which Aamir Khan “shows he cares two hoots about the sentiments of his countrymen”.

“If Khan really thinks that he is truly secular then why is he shooting in Turkey, because Istanbul supports Pakistan on Jammu and Kashmir. The people of India haven’t forgotten Aamir Khan’s interview in which he said his wife Kiran Rao is scared of living in India because intolerance in the country has risen,” it says.

Hitesh Shankar, editor of the magazine, told ThePrint, “This edition of the magazine focuses on the different shades of the entertainment industry, which includes Aamir Khan, the OTT platform, etc.

“As far as the article on Aamir Khan is concerned, the writer has correctly pointed out that while Salman Khan’s Sultan didn’t do well in China, Dangal did (both are on the subject of wrestling). Aamir seems to be the favourite of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) system and the fact his movies are doing so well is an indication that he is being promoted by Chinese state,” Shankar claimed.

“China has complete disregard for Indian sentiments, and it seems Aamir does too. Chinese companies like Vivo have been found violating norms, and Aamir Khan is the brand ambassador of the same company,” he said, adding that the actor pushes fake narratives and is part of the “intolerance brigade” who feel scared of India.

The article wants Aamir Khan to answer to allegations of colluding with anti-India forces.
