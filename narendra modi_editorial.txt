Open and safe: The Hindu Editorial on Narendra Modi government’s COVID-19 vaccination policy</p></p>The Abrogation Of The Special Status Of Jammu , Kashmir , To The Landmark Ayodhya Verdict , Proved To Be An Eventful Year. , </p></p>Prime Minister Modi is right about lockdowns, but the vaccination policy needs reform

If Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address to the country amid the raging storm of COVID-19 cases was intended as reassurance of the government’s commitment to averting economic decline and ramping up health facilities, he provided little insight into specific measures. It should be evident from the pace of infection spread and the large number of deaths in several regions that the sensible course open to the Centre and State governments is to enable economic production and consumption while massively scaling-up the health response. Mr. Modi, who advised States to treat lockdowns as a last resort, has virtually acknowledged, with the benefit of hindsight, that last year’s measure dealt a severe blow to unorganised labour and the self-employed. The priority now is for the workforce to be vaccinated and containment measures against disease spread to be restricted to micro locations. Yet, the crucial question is that of universalising vaccinations for everyone above 18 years of age from May 1. The Centre’s latest policy has effectively opened the floodgates to an unregulated system with market-determined vaccine pricing. Rather than use monopsonist power to procure all vaccines for price-capped distribution, extending the model that has been in place since March 1, the move has led to a 266% to 400% price increase for Covishield for State governments and private hospitals, respectively. Bharat Biotech has also hinted at the need to recover its investments in Covaxin through price flexibility. Manufacturers should not be rushing to seek approvals in those regions where the profits are the highest, leaving out the poorer territories. All vaccines need a sustainable manufacturing base, but the government must ensure a good, free people’s vaccine for all.

With 2,94,365 new cases and 2,011 dead on just April 20, India is waging a war against the virus that calls for strong leadership, decentralisation to allow States to take speedy action and the effective use of regulatory authority. The Prime Minister is right to identify urban workers and labour as key coverage groups for vaccination, with support from the Centre and States. Here, the Union Budget allocation of ₹35,000 crore for COVID-19 vaccines should be able to cover more categories this year and the outlay can be enhanced if necessary. Worldwide, governments have made COVID-19 vaccination a fully state-funded effort. The case for free market pricing for vaccines, on the ground that private enterprise is leading vaccine development, is overstated. For AstraZeneca-Covishield, the single biggest research funding component, at over £38 million, came from the British government, followed by overseas governments, universities and charities. What India needs is free universal vaccination, modelled on the polio campaign. The Centre cannot abdicate that responsibility.</p></p></p></p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</p></p>Narendra Modi</p></p></p></p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the 14th Indian Prime Minister. Mr. Modi belongs to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and has previously served as the Chief Minister of the State of Gujarat for almost three terms. Ahead of Lok Sabha elections in 2014, the BJP fielded him as the PM candidate. Mr. Modi then resigned from the post of CM and became the PM in 2014 after the party won the General Elections with sweeping majority. Mr. Modi is currently serving his second term as the PM, after BJP regained majority in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.</p></p></p></p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</p></p>Fact Check: This article praising PM Modi was not published by ‘The New York Times’</p></p></p></p>An article eulogising Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said to be written by the editor-in-chief of “The New York Times”, is being widely circulated on social media. Joseph Hope, the said editor, calls Modi a “dangerous patriot” whose leadership skills and political acumen are posing a serious threat to other superpowers.

Many Twitter and Facebook users have shared the content, claiming that it was published by “The New York Times”. The same article was also posted in some blogs with the title “*Who is Modi?* commented by *New York Times Editor-in-Chief Joseph Hope”.

“Narendra Modi’s sole aim is to make India a better Country.. If he is not stopped, in the future India will become the most Powerful Nation in the World.. It will surprise the United States, the United Kingdom, and Russia..” reads part of the text.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that “The New York Times” has not published the article. It said there is nobody by the name “Joseph Hope” in the organisation and its editor Dean Baquet has written no such article on Modi.

The archived versions of these posts are saved here, here, here and here.

Not an NYT article

The language of the viral article makes it look suspicious from the very beginning. The lousy sentences and grammatical errors are unlike the editorial standards of “The New York Times”.

We searched “The New York Times” but could not find any such article or opinion piece on its website. We then looked for “Joseph Hope” in the website’s “Our People” section but could not find any such name in the list of profiles. This was strange given the fact that Joseph Hope has been claimed to be the editor-in-chief of NYT in the social media posts.

We found an independent researcher named “Joseph Hope” who writes for Asia Times. But none of his articles match with the viral one.

For further clarification, India Today reached out to Danielle Rhoades Ha, vice president, communications, at NYT. She mailed back refuting the viral claim, saying no such article was published in The New York Times and “No one named Joseph Hope works for The New York Times”.

She further said, “The editor of The New York Times is Dean Baquet and he has not said or written the attached message. Our newsroom is independent and relies on original reporting from more than 1,700 journalists; our global report can be found at NYTimes.com.”

In October 2020, “The New York Times” had written an article on the Indo-China border tensions, wherein it said, “Mr. Modi, a Hindu nationalist, has been criticized heavily for actions that have disenfranchised Muslims in India”.

Hence, it is clear that the viral message claiming NYT editor-in-chief Joseph Hope wrote an article praising PM Modi is false. Neither does any Joseph Hope work at NYT nor has anyone else at the media organisation written such an article about PM Modi.

</p></p>The Guardian view on Modi’s mistakes: a pandemic that is out of control</p></p></p></p>Political hubris met pandemic reality in India this week. At the beginning of March, the Hindu nationalist government of Narendra Modi claimed the country was in Covid-19’s “endgame”. India is now in a living hell. A new “double mutant” variant, named B.1.617, has emerged in a devastating coronavirus second wave which has seen hospitals run out of beds and oxygen. Mortuaries are so full that bodies are left to decompose at home. Charities warn that the dead risk being left on the streets.

On Friday India recorded 332,730 new Sars‑CoV‑2 infections, the highest one-day increase in cases worldwide for the second day in a row. More than 2,200 deaths were recorded in the previous 24 hours. Nations have either banned flights from India, suggested avoiding travelling there or insisted visitors quarantine on their return. Yet little more than six weeks ago, Mr Modi, with not even 1% of the population vaccinated, declared that the country was the “world’s pharmacy” and signalled that pre-pandemic life could resume. Superspreading took place when thousands filled cricket stadiums and millions of Hindus took a dip in the Ganges during the Kumbh Mela festival.

Like Donald Trump, Mr Modi would not give up campaigning while the pandemic raged. India went ahead with five state elections in April, and an unmasked Mr Modi held huge rallies. Mr Modi’s brand of Indian exceptionalism bred complacency. A presumption of national greatness has led to a lack of preparedness, most notably in vaccine production. The west had encouraged India to become a linchpin in global drug-making, but this week Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, suggested this might have been a mistake. China and the US are now manufacturing more Covid-19 vaccines than India, which has yet to convince Washington to ease export controls, forcing the country to import jabs from Russia.

The Indian prime minister suffers from overconfidence in his own instincts and pooh-poohs expert advice. His ministers turned on a former Congress prime minister for daring to offer them counsel just before he was admitted to hospital with Covid this week. Last year, Mr Modi sprang a draconian sudden lockdown on India’s billion people. A shutdown without warning went against the advice of the country’s top epidemiologists, but suited his taste for dramatic gestures. With a younger population, the proportion of Indians who died from Covid-19 was going to be lower than other nations. While suspicions about undercounting the dead linger, an unfounded sense that Indians were somehow more immune to the virus has spread, unchallenged by Mr Modi.

02:10 India Covid crisis: families' plea for help amid oxygen shortages and mass cremations – video report

In the first wave, Covid struck India’s cities, but it is now moving to rural areas, where most of the country lives. As with many of the countries hit hardest, India’s death toll was largely avoidable and a result of arrogant and incompetent government. India is a big, complex and diverse country that is difficult to govern at the best of times, let alone during a national emergency. It is now suffering from parallel epidemics of coronavirus and fear. To contain biological and social contagions requires credible reassurance, to quell panic, and for people to wear masks and obey rules of physical distancing.

Mr Modi has put the onus on state governments to clear up his mess. The buck stops with him. He should acknowledge and make amends for mistakes that have caused enormous suffering. He needs to engage with experts on how to uphold restrictions; ensure government delivery matches promises; and drop the sectarian ideology that divides when unity is required. Future historians will judge Mr Modi harshly if he continues with the exceptionalist views that have led to a disastrous public health outcome.</p></p></p></p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</p></p>Did New York Times' Editor-In-Chief Praise Narendra Modi? Not Really</p></p></p></p>Multiple Facebook posts have shared a purported statement from "Joseph Hope, editor-in-chief of The New York Times" that praises Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The claim is false; there is no "Joseph Hope" listed as an employee at The New York Times and the paper said its editor Dean Baquet did not say or write the message circulating online.

The purported statement was published on January 25, 2021, here in a Facebook group called "Warriors of Social Media - Supporters of Modi"

"Joseph Hope, editor-in-chief of the New York Times: Narendra Modi's sole aim is to make India a better country," the post reads.

"If he is not stopped, in the future India will become the most powerful nation in the world. It will surprise the United States, the United Kingdom, and Russia."

The post goes on to praise Modi's policies, including seeking to tighten India's grip on the disputed Kashmir region.

The same purported statement was published on various Facebook pages in India, including here and here.

The claim, however, is false.

On January 30, 2021, the New York Times communications office tweeted a screenshot of an article from Indian news website The Logical Indian that debunks the claim.

In the screenshot, a statement from a New York Times spokesperson reads: "The editor of The New York Times is Dean Baquet and he has not said or written the attached message."

The spokesperson added that "No one named Joseph Hope works for The New York Times."

</p></p>Narendra Modi Is on the 2020 TIME 100 List</p></p>Jimmy Kimmel , Taraji P. Henson , Chris Patten , Maya Moore , Anthony Kennedy , Jamie Dimon , </p></p>The key to democracy is not, in fact, free elections. Those only tell who got the most votes. More important is the rights of those who did not vote for the winner. India has been the world’s largest democracy for more than seven decades. Its population of 1.3 billion includes Christians, Muslims, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains and other religious sects. All have abided in India, which the Dalai Lama (who has spent most of his life in refuge there) has lauded as “an example of harmony and stability.”

Narendra Modi has brought all that into doubt. Though almost all of India’s Prime Ministers have come from the nearly 80% of the population that is Hindu, only Modi has governed as if no one else matters. First elected on a populist promise of empowerment, his Hindu-­nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party rejected not only elitism but also pluralism, specifically targeting India’s Muslims. The crucible of the pandemic became a pretense for stifling dissent. And the world’s most vibrant democracy fell deeper into shadow.

</p></p>French newspaper blames Modi’s arrogance for Covid resurgence</p></p></p></p>Le Monde's editorial tore apart the PM’s much publicised vaccine strategy, contending that the diplomacy was subservient to his ambitions

Foreign newspapers are not exactly quaking in their boots after the Indian foreign policy establishment sought to lecture an Australian newspaper that had said “Modi leads India into a viral apocalypse”.

Le Monde, the French newspaper, on Wednesday chipped away at the hitherto Teflon-coated image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The French newspaper blamed his “arrogance and demagogy” as much as the “unpredictability of the virus” for the second deadly wave of the pandemic in India.

“The spectacle of lines of ambulances at the gates of overwhelmed hospitals, of sick people’s relatives begging in vain to obtain oxygen and of mass cremations does not lie. From cities to rural areas, from the rich to the poor, the carnage does not spare anyone. Declining until February, the curve of new infection is nearly vertical,” Le Monde said in its editorial.</p></p></p></p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</p></p>Modi’s clear message | HT Editorial</p></p></p></p>Being “vocal for local” co-exists very uncomfortably with “zero effect, zero defect.” In every public speech these days, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi has spoken of the need for economic self-reliance, embodied in the slogan Atmanirbhar Bharat. His latest radio address was no different. He praised individuals who had purged foreign-made items from lists of daily-use products. This was blended with his larger vision of national revival, speaking of “things manufactured abroad” having “shackled” Indians. But the PM went on to demand “a clear message for our manufacturers that they should not compromise on the quality of the products.” Made in India products, he insisted, must “meet global standards.”

It may not be obvious, but these two imperatives do no align with each other. If Indian consumers were to move en masse to only products made in their country, they would give domestic manufacturers a captive market. The impetus for an Indian factory-owner to then invest in improving his products would largely evaporate. Modi has remarkable powers of persuasion, but even he cannot change basic economic behaviour. The most important driver of innovation for a corporation is competition. Without the sense that a product is losing out to rivals, there is no incentive for a firm to invest in research or create a managerial environment conducive to change. Domestic competition is not enough. Cartelisation is almost inevitable in such situations, especially when regulators are weak. Price tags become inflated and global standards are sacrificed.

Reviving the manufacturing sector would help create the jobs that would, in turn, feed a post-pandemic domestic recovery. Additionally, there is a strategic need to reduce China’s economic footprint in the country – the country is the single largest source of imported goods into India. There is a strong case for putting up barriers to Chinese products given deteriorating relations and their restrictions on Indian imports. The real danger is that the idea that pushing Indian products will help long-term growth will come to permeate policy-making. This could not be further from the truth. Any reduction in competition in a market economy can be guaranteed to ensure economic mediocrity. What Indian firms need is help to become globally competitive, not captive nationalistic consumers.</p></p></p></p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
