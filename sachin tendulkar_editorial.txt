Sachin Tendulkar is not the first of India’s sporting heroes: there were several before him, and even some after 1989, the year he made his international debut. That he became a nonpareil sporting icon is not only due to his feats on the cricket field, which were without doubt many, but also because of the times he lived in. Tendulkar’s rise as an unprecedented nationwide hero-phenomenon coincided with India’s growth into a major economy, a period when the country’s rapidly growing middle class followed the game on television and drew in advertisers and sponsors. The master-blaster gave ordinary Indians a chance to think of themselves as world-beaters, even if not in a truly global sport. For them, Tendulkar filled a void larger than the hole in the Indian team’s middle-order. For a generation starved of heroes, and short on confidence, he served as a source of inspiration and motivation. Even when Indian cricket got mired in charges of fixing and bribery, Tendulkar was left untouched. And in the eyes of his fans, he could do no wrong, whether on or off the field. The extraordinary outpouring of emotions at his farewell match on his home ground in Mumbai was thus not unexpected. Indian cricket is now on a high, and he might not leave as big a hole as the one he filled 24 years ago, but for India’s cricket fans the game would not be the same anymore.

Given his popularity and iconic status, the Central government obviously did not want to lose even a day in honouring him with the Bharat Ratna. For some years now, the cricketer’s fans in high places have been quite vocal in demanding a Bharat Ratna for him. Indeed, the rules governing eligibility for the highest civilian award were modified two years ago apparently to keep the doors open for Tendulkar to receive the honour on his retirement. As per the revised criteria, it can be awarded for exceptional performance in any field of human endeavour. After having nominated him to Parliament last year, there was little doubt that the Congress-led government would take the first opportunity to honour him. And that opportunity came the day the Mumbai Test, Tendulkar’s 200th, ended. To be conferred the award is one thing; to force a change in the eligibility criteria for the award is quite another. It was almost as if the award would lose some of its sheen if Tendulkar were not among the recipients. At 40, the cricket icon is the youngest ever to receive the award. Unlike many others who have received the honour in the last six decades, he did not have to wait for the award; the award waited for him. The honour was India’s, as much as Tendulkar’s.</p></p></p></p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</p></p>Sachin Tendulkar: favoured by all</p></p></p></p>From the > Sportstar

Great sportsmen straddle many worlds. They leave behind the merely good very quickly as they enter rarefied areas defined as much by their mastery as by the elements that do not even enter the debate when others are discussed. Part of Don Bradman's greatness lay in his Test average of 99.94, but partly it was also a function of what he meant to a nation coming to terms with itself; he defined Australian nationhood.

It is an accident of time and space, this identification with an evolving nation, but it is crucial to the understanding of the context of greatness. W. G. Grace, for example, was the icon of Victorian England, representing both its elements and its aspirations. Such players dominate their era, and tell us there is more to greatness in batting than a fabulous cover drive or a delicate leg glance.

The intangibles enter the equation, and other things remaining equal (statistics, averages, role in victories), the intangibles tip the balance. There was a time when it was difficult to separate the careers of Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara — both had similar statistics, influence on their teams, impact on bowlers around the world. Lara's taste for huge scores meant he held the individual batting record for both Tests and first class cricket, 375 and 501 respectively made within two months of each other in 1994. Tendulkar, four years younger, more consistent, less flamboyant, more sober, less controversial, frustrated the bowlers with a defence of Gavaskar-like certainty and an attack that could match Lara's.

“Sachin is a genius,” said Lara himself, “I am a mere mortal.”

Even if that is taken as a modest assessment by a great rival when Lara first made the point, today it is difficult to disagree. After Tendulkar's ‘ Second Coming', the statistics too go in favour of the Indian. At 37, when Lara called it a day, Tendulkar discovered a new steel, a new joy of batsmanship, a new purpose that was difficult to distinguish from those he entered the game with at the age of 16. In his last 15 Tests, Tendulkar has scored 1811 runs, with eight centuries and an average of 86.23. To get Bradmanesque when others of his age are rediscovering the joys of fatherhood or the comforts of the commentary box places Tendulkar not just in another league, but on another planet altogether.

The debate today is not about who is the best batsman after Bradman, it is about deciding whether Tendulkar is better than Bradman was given the range of his game (Bradman didn't play a single one-dayer, Tendulkar the greatest batsman without argument in that form of the game has played 442), the travel, the greater media and public pressure and the fact that he has played more years (Bradman had a break of five years during the War), on more grounds (57 different Test grounds in 10 countries to Bradman's 10 in two countries), and destroyed more bowling attacks.

Tendulkar versus Lara, let's get the statistics out of the way first. Lara ended his career after 131 Tests, 11,953 runs, an average of 52.88 and 34 centuries. Tendulkar's figures at the end of his 131st Test (he played 23 fewer innings) were 10,434 runs, an average of 55.79 and 35 centuries. Little to choose there between the two, although Tendulkar's current figures tend to border on the verge of absurdity, like the US budget deficit or the temperature at the centre of the sun. Body willing, Tendulkar could play 200 Test matches, score 16 or 17 thousand runs and over 55 centuries. This is not just startling, but faintly ridiculous too. Such figures cease to have any real meaning simply because it is difficult to get our minds around them.

And when you consider that there could be another 50 ODI centuries and nearly 20,000 runs in that format, it would be foolish to even consider anyone else in the same league. Lara, twice holder of the individual score, the first man to make 400 in a Test innings will have to move into that portion of the stage inhabited by second fiddles.

But, as mentioned earlier, the debate cannot be reduced to statistics and averages, for then we would be ignoring the intangibles that make up the whole picture. Statistics can only be the basis for starting the debate. Greatness is made up of other elements you cannot put a decimal point on. Such things as respect for the craft, contribution to the team.

Lara, a great player in a mediocre team, has had to go it alone for most of his career, finishing on the winning side only 32 times. His average in Tests won is 61.02 (eight centuries). Tendulkar, by contrast, averages 69.14 in the 59 Tests India won when he was playing (20 centuries).

So stunning has been the impact of his figures that Tendulkar's historical contribution to Indian cricket is often forgotten. In a recent exercise to choose an all-time India XI, it became apparent even to those generally slow to recognise good times when they are living through it that the Golden Age of Indian cricket is here and now. Four players in the list were current national players, and two had retired only recently.

In sport, greatness is usually bestowed retrospectively. Perhaps it is no coincidence that India are currently the number one side in the world.

That six of the eleven made their debuts after November 1989, when Tendulkar first announced himself to the world, is a tribute to the Mumbai man's impact. Golden Ages must have their iconic figure and Tendulkar is clearly the one here, both for what he has accomplished himself and for his qualities that inspired the others.

Lara, through no fault of his own, presided over the decline of West Indies cricket and his impact therefore has been far less than Tendulkar's on Indian cricket and cricket-watching public.

The major difference between the two great players has been in their attitude towards the game. Lara, like, Tiger Woods in another context, has always had a sense of entitlement, a feeling that cricket owed him for his being one of its most accomplished players. This was especially evident during his stints as captain and the tantrums he threw when his wishes were not met. Tendulkar might not have taken up the cause of players when a word from him could have made a difference, but he had no sense of entitlement. The guiding force was gratitude to the sport for making him what he is.

Like Bradman in another era, Tendulkar too has been both representative and flag-bearer of a nation rediscovering its self-confidence and redefining its identity. Diffidence has been replaced by inspired self-worth, and in a nation often riven by faith and religion and artificial lines of separation, he has been a hero across the divisions. Again, it is not Lara's fault that he cannot play a similar role in a country, the West Indies, that exists only on the cricket field but divides into Jamaica and Trinidad and Barbados and others off it.

Tendulkar is a product of his period. Time and space are in his favour. As are those qualities that define greatness, discipline, tough work ethic, the ability to both extract joy from the game and distribute it to millions as well as the creativity to invent new ways of scoring runs, and the ability to score them consistently.

Lara will have his supporters, but for the majority of fans (and not necessarily in the subcontinent), the debate was resolved long ago. Tendulkar first.</p></p></p></p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From watchtowers to modern interactive platform, here's what Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary has to offer 03:09

The 'god of cricket' master blasteris in the spotlight amid an ongoing battle betweenand the Narendra Modi-led government for his tweet. Now, Twitter users are sharing a video of lateSupremo's views on the cricketer.The viral video comes at a time when the Bharat Ratan awardee's tweet has evoked strong reactions from both sides.On Wednesday, the Ministry of External Affairs's (MEA) strongly criticised remarks in support of farmers by Rihanna, Swedish teen climate activist Greta Thunberg and others accusing some 'vested interest groups' of trying to enforce their agenda.Soon after, Sachin took to Twitter and said that India’s sovereignty cannot be compromised, adding, "External forces can be spectators but not participants. Indians know India and should decide for India. Let's remain united as a nation."Balasaheb Thackeray's interview is from 2014 in which the late political leader justified his criticism of Sachin saying the cricketer should stick to the cricket pitch and leave the political pitch for politicians.When asked about slamming Sachin Tendulkar in 2009 in an editorial piece published in the party's mouthpiece Saamana over his 'Mumbai belongs to India' remark, Thackeray had said, "To say something about Mumbai, thatbelongs to the country. No, we fought for Mumbai, 105 people laid down their lives. And so on and so on there is a Hutatma chowk, so I said don't talk about Mumbai. I said, if you say we cricketers belong to the country, yes, I will accept that. (They) play for the country but they play for the money."However, when Thackeray was told that he shouldn't say such things about Sachin, Thackeray responded saying, "Don't give so much of a guarantee, if the situation arises, if you need money for some cause, he will give you a bat to auction it and when the money comes, deposit it (in the needy's account).When further Thackeray was told that the bat has value and he was not selling it and instead of giving it (for a cause), the late Shiv Sena Supremo had said, "What is the tendency. Such a stingy thing. Why don't you give in kind, cash is different.""Baburao Patel has given a wonderful answer in his editors' mail, the editor of Film India. A man asked him a question, what Nehru has left for the country? He said, "Cash for his daughter and ash for the country. Just one c to ash becomes cash. This is Sachin Tendulkar.Further, Thackeray says (referring to his comment on Mumbai), "I said he should not get involved, his pitch is different, his pitch is not a political pitch, the political pitch is ours,' we play on that."Meanwhile, read why several Twitter users have slammed him for his tweet - Read more here.

</p></p>Cricket will emerge a different sport in post-Covid world: Sachin Tendulkar | EXCLUSIVE</p></p></p></p>This will be a very different 24th April for Sachin Tendulkar, who will have to spend his 47th birthday celebrating at home with his family, and looking at ways to help with the fight against Covid-19. In a chat with Hindustan Times, a day before his birthday, he speaks about routines athletes need to follow during the lockdown to keep themselves fit and motivated, and how cricket will emerge as a different sport post this pandemic.

Excerpts:

Q: In lockdown one has not much to do. What’s your routine?

My day starts with exercise. Then (I get busy) with stuff related to Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar Sports Management (SRTSM) where we discuss all pending things.

With the lockdown, both Anjali and me are getting a lot of time with our kids. I have not been travelling, so my mother is also getting lots of time with me.

We are playing board games, watching movies and TV series, and listening to music right from the 70s to this day. The children and me take turns (picking songs) so we can develop a taste for their type of music. They already know my type of music.

(For sportspeople), it’s equally important to know (when to) switch on and switch off. You have to keep your mental fitness going as well, it’s not just about physical fitness. If you are mentally healthy, you know this time will pass too. And when it passes, you are in a good state of mind to move on to the next challenge.

How difficult will it be for top level players to get back into rhythm once cricket resumes?

I’m sure no tournament is going to happen out of the blue. Nobody is going to say that today the lockdown is over from tomorrow you have to go out and play a match. So players will get time to prepare. All these current players have a certain level of fitness and for that to diminish, it takes a long time. It all depends on how smartly you want to utilise this time and move forward.

Post COVID-19 how do you see the game changing? There is a lot of debate on the use of saliva to maintain the ball. Your thoughts?

The method of shining the ball is going to change now. I don’t know what it will be as a lot of it would have to do with hygiene. Celebrations also (will change); one can’t do high-fives or hug each other. Hopefully the game will start after we overcome this challenge but I feel that element will stay somewhere in the back of the mind. It will eventually boil down to the hygiene levels we maintain. So, to maintain certain level of hygiene not just during this phase but post this phase is also going to be critical for everyone.

Cricket Australia is contemplating holding the T20 World cup without fans. Top European football leagues are planning to do so as well…

It would be a strange feeling to be inside an empty stadium. Because you draw lot of energy from the crowd after hitting a boundary or after taking a wicket. So, you are not going to get all that. It may even seem like net practice. Drawing that energy from the spectators, that feel is going to be lost without any doubt.

There are reports of Cricket Australia planning a Test series with India exclusively at Adelaide Oval with players staying in the ground’s new hotel. What do you think of the idea?

I don’t endorse it all. It’s not something I’m particularly excited about. You could maybe look at a one-day series but to have 25 days of Test cricket at one venue…I don’t endorse that.

The IPL has been put on the backburner now. How will it impact the people involved?

Lockdown is for everyone. It will be unfair to single out just the IPL as a tournament and say so many people are losing their livelihoods. We need to understand why this is happening. This is all happening in the interest of our nation, and nothing comes above that.</p></p></p></p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
