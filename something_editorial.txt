When is Nothing Something? Editorial for the Null Results Special Issue of Journal of Business and Psychology</p></p>Ronald S.

First, what if an organization was choosing between investing resources in one of two training programs? Imagine further that one of the interventions was relatively inexpensive (e.g., $50 per employee) and the other was relatively expensive (e.g., $100 per employee). If data collected from multiple experiments revealed that there was no significant difference in the effect of these training programs on valued outcomes (e.g., employee performance), such results would be quite valuable to organizational decision makers.

A second scenario in which we might find null results not only valuable, but also even ideal, is when we create a test. With almost all such cases, we hope our test does not show differences across subgroups and that the weight associated with the interaction term in our regression model was nonsignificant. Extending this example to a related context, imagine a researcher testing a structural model in which she hopes to find evidence that the set of relations is similar between males and females. In testing this model, the researcher compares two models. One of the models allows for the parameters to freely vary while the second constrains the loadings to be equal across groups. If the fit of the second model were not significantly different than the fit of the first, the researcher would be pleased.

A third scenario may involve the testing of a theory and it’s various propositions. Although finding data supportive of particular propositions is certainly noteworthy, so is the case of finding that certain propositions are not supported. In other words, the researcher’s null findings serve as key information for the usefulness and/or validity of the theory in question.

The Elephant in the Room

To this point, we have painted a somewhat rosy picture of null results. We cannot ignore, however, the fact that null results may often be the product of poor research design, inadequate measurement, or a host of other methodological shortcomings. In a recent commentary, Leavitt (2013) succinctly summarized why uncritical interpretation of null results may lead to a far worse scientific corpus than ignoring meaningful null results ever would. Rather than assuming that all null results are to be discarded, however, we believe that those produced through rigorous designs may provide important information.

A More Complete Picture

Ultimately, our science is better to the extent that we publish robust findings that emerge in our research studies regardless of whether those results are "significant" or "nonsignificant." The spirit behind this special issue is to suggest that we need a complete picture of our phenomena of interest to truly advance our scientific knowledge. Not publishing meaningful null results is like painting a picture of a landscape on a clear day missing the color blue. We can appreciate that editorial decisions would certainly be rendered simpler by applying a shorthand rule of thumb like, “Papers that report null results should be rejected.” Such a rule of thumb, however, is an oversimplification and one that may have a deleterious effect on our accumulated knowledge. In the following sections, we offer some recommendations to editors, reviewers, and authors that may facilitate the appropriate evaluation of null results in our literature.</p></p></p></p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</p></p>(PDF) When is Nothing Something? Editorial for the Null Results Special Issue of Journal of Business and Psychology</p></p>Authors , </p></p>In the remainder of this editorial statement, we would

like to address the broad issue of publishing null results and

provide a summary of how the papers in this special half-

issue are examples of how null results inform our science.

What Happened?

In thinking about why we received relatively few propos-

als, several explanations seem possible. For example,

perhaps there are simply few times when we conduct

research and actually observe null results. This, of course,

is patently absurd. Another potential explanation is that our

call for proposals went unnoticed and was simply not

communicated widely and loudly enough. Though this

possibility is more realistic than the ﬁrst, our call went

through the same channels as almost all other special issue

calls for proposals, so it also seems an unlikely reason. A

third possible explanation is that we, as a ﬁeld, are simply

not conditioned to respond to a call as outlandish as one

asking for null results. Indeed, the request for null results

may have struck many researchers as so ‘ ‘out there’ ’ as to

strain credulity. Perhaps people thought this call for pro-

posals was a product of The Onion ?

Most compelling to us, perhaps the reason we received

the relatively few proposals that we did is a product of

(a) being conditioned to view null results as worthless and

(b) recognition (self-awareness) of the methodological

deﬁciencies in our own work that may be driving null

results. If the ﬁrst reason was the primary driver of indi-

viduals’ decisions not to submit to this special issue, we

need to more broadly consider the value of research and not

to be so quick to assume that null ﬁndings mean, we learn

nothing from the study (Landis and Rogelberg 2013 ). If the

second reason is the explanation, then we should be col-

lectively proud that we recognize null results frequently are

produced by measures with poor reliability, research

designs that are not appropriate for answering the question

at hand, low statistical power, and a litany of other meth-

odological ﬂaws.

Why Encourage Publication of Null Results?

Why might we encourage null results and want a home for

them? We can think of several possible reasons. First, what

if an organization was choosing between investing

resources in one of two training programs? Imagine further

that one of the interventions was relatively inexpensive

(e.g., $50 per employee) and the other was relatively

expensive (e.g., $100 per employee). If data collected from

multiple experiments revealed that there was no signiﬁcant

difference in the effect of these training programs on

valued outcomes (e.g., employee performance), such

results would be quite valuable to organizational decision

makers.

A second scenario in which we might ﬁnd null results

not only valuable, but also even ideal, is when we create a

test. With almost all such cases, we hope our test does not

show differences across subgroups and that the weight

associated with the interaction term in our regression

model was nonsigniﬁcant. Extending this example to a

related context, imagine a researcher testing a stru ctural

model in which she hopes to ﬁnd evidence that the set of

relations is similar between males and females. In testing

this model, the researcher compares two models. One of

the models allows for the parameters to freely vary while

the second constrains the loadings to be equal across

groups. If the ﬁt of the second model were not signiﬁcantly

different than the ﬁt of the ﬁrst, the researcher would be

pleased.

A third scenario may involve the testing of a theory and

it’s various propositions. Although ﬁnding data supportive

of particular propositions is certainly noteworthy, so is the

case of ﬁnding that certain propositions are not supported.

In other words, the researcher’s null ﬁndings serve as key

information for the usefulness and/or validity of the theory

in question.
