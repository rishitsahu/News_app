Virat Kohli is a colossal figure of modern cricket</p></p></p></p>In cricket, it is the captain who bears the cross. The pressure to perform consistently, individually and as a team, has caused great players to shun the mantle of captaincy. For example, Sachin Tendulkar, arguably the greatest batsman produced by India thus far, accomplished little while captaining the side. The burden of captaincy had taken some of the sheen of his batting. But the current Indian skipper, Virat Kohli, seems to relish the challenge of leadership. His record as a batsman remains glittering as ever. The fact that Mr Kohli has become the first player in the history of the game to win not one, or two, but three top awards — the International Cricket Council’s Cricketer of the Year, Test Cricketer of the Year and ODI Cricketer of the Year — in a calendar year bears testimony to his unique ability to seamlessly balance the demands of batsmanship and captaincy. These honours reaffirm Mr Kohli’s special talents: he has dominated both the longer and one of the shorter versions of the game, leaving his competitors behind. It must also be mentioned that Mr Kohli has the added responsibility of leading the Indian team in all formats of the game. There is another heartening feature about Mr Kohli’s accomplishment. During 2018, India had played a lot of cricket overseas — in Australia, England and South Africa — tours that are considered to be the toughest tests for Indian batsmen who are adjudged to be uncomfortable with the pace and bounce offered by the surfaces there. But Mr Kohli has tamed these terrors: the runs that he piled and his healthy average are proof of that. India also registered their first-ever series win in both Tests and one-day internationals against Australia on their soil under Mr Kohli’s leadership.

Mr Kohli’s exuberance may raise eyebrows among traditional cricket lovers. But there can be no denying the fact that the Indian captain is a colossal figure of the modern game. Youngsters around the world would not be faulted for choosing Mr Kohli as their model for his prodigious abilities. But a captain’s job does not end with scoring runs, taking wickets, or winning games. Mr Kohli’s legacy would be judged by the standards that Indian cricket would achieve by the time he hangs up his boots. He, along with the Board of Control for Cricket in India, should continue to endorse an institutional culture that rises above parochialism to extend all kinds of support to nurture talent. Securing the future of Indian cricket remains one among many of Mr Kohli’s formidable responsibilities.</p></p></p></p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</p></p>Opinion| Virat Kohli is a modern great, he needn’t be loutish</p></p></p></p>The actor, Naseeruddin Shah, has articulated what many Indian cricket fans have been thinking: Virat Kohli is the world’s worst behaved player. “His cricketing brilliance pales beside his arrogance and bad manners,” Shah wrote on Facebook on Monday. This is not new for Kohli. Even before he made his name as a cricketer on the senior circuit, he had made a name for himself as a boorish, bratty lout of a teenager.

That nasty streak, kept somewhat in check when he was a young player in a team peopled by colossuses such as Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid (players whose batsmanship was the sole sign of machismo and competitiveness), has been afforded free expression as Kohli has zoomed upwards in the echelons of the modern game. And it has come to define his on field presence as he has assumed captaincy, been offered the unstinted support of his coach, Ravi Shastri, and swiftly become the single most powerful man in Indian cricket. Moreover, he has tried to fashion the team in his image.

Aggression on the field, in terms of play, is no bad thing. But unwarranted aggression in terms of personal conduct goes by another name: loutishness. It is also, in Kohli’s case, exacerbated by a sense of entitlement and arrogance that he exhibits at press conferences. Especially over the past few years (coinciding with the strengthening of his position as Indian cricket’s sole centre of power), Kohli has repeatedly behaved in ways that are unbecoming of an India cricket captain, of a man who happens to be an important ambassador of the country.

It is a pity. He really does not need to do this. He is a modern great; his batting speaks for itself; and Kohli gains little by saying and doing things that gain him few admirers. There have been aggressive captains in the history of the game (including our own Sourav Ganguly). But none of them have disrespected their opponents. Kohli’s behaviour is disrespectful towards his opponents. Worse, it disrespects the game.</p></p></p></p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</p></p>A Virat feat</p></p>Var Follow_Widget_Data , Af_Article_Count , Ie_Mobile_Check , No , Ajax_Url , Https , Indianexpress.Com , Wp-Admin , Admin-Ajax.Php , Tracking_C , </p></p>When Virat Kohli completed 12,000 ODI runs on Wednesday, the fastest to the feat and in 58 fewer innings than Sachin Tendulkar, the buzz was mostly academic. It’s because Kohli has got the audience accustomed to his greatness, so much so that the 12k-milestone seems just another conquest.

With Kohli, in the 50-over game, it has always been about what records he would end up with rather than the ones he could break. By the time the 32-year-old retires — given his high fitness and motivation levels, he has a long way to go — he would have owned most records in the format. Already, he’s just six centuries shy of breaking Tendulkar’s world-record tally of 49 hundreds. Given his century-striking rate, he could surpass the man he grew up idolising as early as next year. Before long, he could obliterate the Little Master’s run tally of 18,426. At this staggering rate of consistency, he could take approximately 110 innings to eclipse Tendulkar as the highest run-getter of all time. But Kohli would not stop with these.

Whatever numbers he eventually ends up with, statistics would be but an embellishment to his mastery of white-ball cricket. There could be contenders to the best Test batsman throne, but Kohli is the undisputed ODI King — arguably, of all time. Few batsmen have raised the bar or stretched the yardsticks of greatness in the 50-over format more than Kohli. His average of 59.31 has made even the mid-40s average, hitherto the gold-standard, look pedestrian. Fewer still have nuanced this format more than Kohli, be it orchestrating a chase, setting a target, picking the perfect man and moment to launch an onslaught, or tweaking his game on the go to suit the diverse conditions. And like all great sportsmen, he gives the impression that the best is yet to be. When he leaves cricket, there would be no superlative unspent, nor many records unbroken.</p></p></p></p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</p></p>Brand Virat Kohli and how he became the world’s most marketable cricketer</p></p>Priyam Marik , </p></p>Text Size: A- A+

It is January 2012, and India are getting hammered in their first Test match of the year at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Australia, led by an imperious Michael Clarke, are batting the visitors out of the game. Having failed with the bat in the first innings, 23-year-old Virat Kohli is being made to run ragged in the outfield, with Aussie supporters at the edge of the boundary line constantly riling him up. With the tide of the game firmly against him and his team, Kohli loses his head and produces a moment of defiance.

There are no swear words from the flamboyant batsman this time, as have been customary after every pulsating century. No, Kohli does not cast a deathly stare towards the home fans, either. Instead, with his back to the crowd, Kohli raises his left fist and nonchalantly flips his middle finger — an unprecedented sight for an Indian cricketer in the gentleman’s game.

More than eight years on, Kohli’s petulance from Sydney remains largely forgotten, a faux pas as rare as a mistimed cover drive. From a precocious and frequently overzealous youngster, the Delhiite has matured to become the most bankable cricketer in the world, both on and off the field.

Forbes’ list for the 100 highest-paid athletes for 2020 ranked Kohli in 66th place, with estimated earnings of $26 million. Kohli was the only cricketer, and sole Indian, on the list.

As Virat Kohli turns 32 today, let’s trace how he became the world’s most marketable cricketer by wedding his sporting excellence to his immense star power.

In a league of his own

While bespoke marketing campaigns often hold the keys for athletes to transition into branding sensations, there remains one common factor behind the commercial success of every sportsperson — performance on the pitch.

During the 2010s, Kohli amassed a mind-boggling 20,960 international runs, studded with 69 centuries, numbers nobody else could equal over the same period. Although India is no stranger to batting geniuses, Kohli’s accomplishments stand out because of his ability to blend emotions with excellence, creating moments that are instantly memorable.

Whether bowing to acknowledge the presence of his idol and former teammate Sachin Tendulkar in the stands en route to a scintillating display against Pakistan, offering a flying kiss to his wife and Bollywood star Anushka Sharma after hitting yet another hundred, or urging Indian fans not to jeer the much-maligned Steven Smith during an intense World Cup fixture against Australia, Kohli does not just dominate games, he decorates them. His intensity, his body language, and his proclivities for camera-friendly gestures mean that Kohli is always hogging the limelight, with or without his monumental batting records.

As a result, Kohli is seen as marketing gold dust for the biggest companies in the world, who naturally want to capitalise on his magnetic personality to connect better with their customers.

But the overwhelming demand for associating with his name has not undermined Kohli’s ability to pick and choose what he really wants to endorse. In becoming the face of cricket, Kohli has quickly realised the importance of selecting endorsements that fit his profile and resonate a carefully calibrated message.

Curating the perfect image

Cricketers do not earn a salary anywhere close to elite international footballers or National Basketball Association (NBA) players. This is because cricket at the highest level mainly involves playing for national teams where contracts are not nearly as lucrative as in club or franchise-based competitions. This means that even for the best in the world like Virat Kohli, income from endorsements and profits from investments vastly outstrip his cricketing pay cheques.

Kohli’s marketing commitments and finances are managed by Cornerstone Sport & Entertainment, whose founder Bunty Sajdeh (a superagent of sorts) also looks after the interests of Indian stars such as K.L. Rahul, Yuvraj Singh, Sania Mirza, among a long list of others.

“When I first saw Virat, during an Under-19 match in Malaysia, he didn’t actually get that many runs. But what struck me was the way he spoke confidently to everyone around him and took charge of situations,” recalled Sajdeh in a 2016 interview, remembering to add that he had signed up Kohli even before the latter had emerged as a regular for Team India.

Sajdeh, whom Kohli fondly calls “Jerry” (in a nod to Tom Cruise’s sports agent character in Jerry Maguire), has been instrumental in ensuring that Kohli’s endorsements express a coherent image of the player, an image that can be encapsulated in three core attributes: passion, fitness, and consistency.

A quick glance at the leading brands Kohli advertises — Puma, Boost, Herbalife, Tissot, Philips, Audi, Google Duo (to name a few) — puts this into perspective, while also shedding light on how Kohli has a definite target audience in mind across most of his commercials: that of the urban (and preferably sport-playing) youth.

Kohli, along with Sajdeh, also understands the importance of forming a personal brand in collaboration with established international ones. This is why in place of renewing his deal with sports manufacturing giant Adidas in 2017, Kohli opted for Puma, which agreed to launch Kohli’s own athleisure line called ‘one8’ (after Kohli’s jersey number of 18). Kohli penned a deal in excess of Rs 100 crore with Puma, widely regarded to be the single-largest endorsement scoop for an Indian athlete. One8 combines Puma’s design with tailormade customisations for Kohli across apparel, footwear, and equipment, much in the same way that Nike has done for basketball legend Michael Jordan over the years through the rise and rise of Air Jordan.

Always conscious of the impact his profile has on the zeitgeist and vice versa, Kohli stopped shooting ads for Pepsi as well as fairness creams in 2017, realising such endorsements involved tacit support for unhealthy diet and colourism. This marked a welcome departure from industry trends where celebrities rarely make an attempt to align the values of their brands with their own beliefs and morality.

Known for wearing his heart on his sleeve, Kohli’s marketability has always been championed by the feeling that what you see is what you get. Even in his investments, be it in fitness centres like Chisel, fashion outlet Wrogn, franchises like FC Goa in the Indian Super League, or his own restaurant in Delhi where he helps out with the menu, Kohli has come to embody a form of authenticity that is at the heart of his perfectly curated image — one that combines trailblazing cricketer with comprehensive statesman, producing an ideal role model in the process. In a country where more than a billion people regularly expect their heroes to do no wrong, Virat Kohli has proven to be incredibly reliable in getting most things right.

Towards international superstardom

“The sport I play, everyone can see on screen. I feel if you just be yourself and honestly put 100%…people connect to you more. I am from that kind of background; I have never tried to be someone else,” is Kohli’s description of his attitude, at a time when he is among the most recognisable figures in India.

Unlike Sachin Tendulkar, whose cricketing story incorporated the ambitions of an economically liberated and aspirational India, or Mahendra Singh Dhoni, whose journey from railway ticket collector to World Cup-winning skipper entrenched the tale of the small-town boy upon India’s collective imagination, Kohli’s stardom is built on more nuanced grounds. Neither the God of Cricket nor Captain Cool, Kohli has been the protagonist of a different story for a different India. An India that is assertive yet introspective, rooted in its origins but open to embracing a multitude of possibilities.

Ultimately, Kohli’s marketability as a cricketer is deeply connected to what Indians — especially the youth — can relate with and approve of. The next challenge, therefore, for the Virat brand is to successfully translate this domestic aura on the international stage, following in the footsteps of players such as LeBron James, Michael Jordan, and Kohli’s favourite, Cristiano Ronaldo.

Due to cricket’s limited viewership (as compared to football, tennis, or even basketball), this will prove difficult, but thanks to social media (Kohli is the most followed Indian on Instagram) and the burgeoning popularity of Kohli’s chosen brands on the international market, it is not altogether impossible.

As an astute businessman, Kohli will be aware that, as this decade unravels, his cricketing genius will begin to wane, meaning he must enhance his international appeal in order to perpetuate his massive commercial heft.

Given his propensity for hunting down whatever targets are set for him, it will come as little surprise if by the end of the 2020s — with a lot of planning and a bit of luck — Virat Kohli elevates himself to the status of a global superstar, progressing from the world’s most marketable cricketer into the world’s most marketable athlete.

</p></p>Virat Kohli’s message is clear: batsmen will be judged by intent</p></p>Last Tuesday , Our Kitchen Tested Positive. Every Time We Took The Cake Out Of The Oven , It Was Lotus-Shaped , </p></p>When India started playing One-Day Internationals, they saw the format as a contraction of five-day cricket. “We played one-day cricket like we did Tests,” admitted their first captain Ajit Wadekar years later.

To be fair, there wasn’t too much to go by — the data revolution accompanying T20 cricket was many decades away. In any case, India looked at ODI with disdain, and little effort was made to understand its specific needs.

History repeated itself when T20 was evolving. India won the first World Cup, but team selection and tactics were redolent of the 50-over game.

The emphasis was on keeping wickets in hand for the final assault, for instance, and batsmen still had the luxury of getting their eye in. This latter is anathema to T20 cricket where, with just 120 balls to negotiate, batsmen could not be allowed such indulgence (unless you were Chris Gayle, but he is an exception).

Attack is key

T20 is a different sport from either of the other two formats of the game. It took India a while to realise this. For long they were happy to pick players based on “white ball” performances in formats that were distinct from each other.

Now there is an acknowledgement of its main elements: attack is the platform on which batsmen build their innings, while bowlers think in terms of single deliveries (which is just over four percent of their quota) rather than overall plans. The batsman attacks, the bowler defends in an inversion of the traditional.

Before the start of the current T20 series, India skipper Virat Kohli set down a mission statement: “We want to be a side that plays free cricket,” he said, “you will see guys more expressive and being much more positive (from now on).”

He thus pointed to an essential truth: what is good for the individual player — playing himself in and getting a decent score — is often not good for the team as a whole. Success has to be measured in terms of attempts made and context, not necessarily runs scored. A 30 in 12 balls is more valuable than 50 in 50. Averages and strike rates paint incomplete pictures.

The captain is, in effect, telling his players to attack early and not hold back for fear of lack of depth in the batting. A few things had to come together before Kohli could make the promise implied in that.

Accent on younger, fitter batsmen

One, the accent had to be on younger, fitter batsmen suitably trained by exposure to international trends in the IPL. Players like Rishabh Pant and now Ishan Kishan bat with a confidence and a healthy disregard for personal glory that is a departure from the old way. This in turn comes from the clear message from the management: you will occasionally be dismissed cheaply doing the right thing for the team, but that will not be held against you.

Two, the conscious moving away from over-reliance on one or two players at the top and a better spread of batting skills. This allows the early batsmen to play without worry while giving the lower order opportunities to contribute and gain confidence. Few teams get dismissed in 120 balls anyway. A team could lose a wicket every 12 balls and still play out the 20 overs.

Three, the jettisoning of many features of the traditional game in the pursuit of the one thing that matters — victory. When Kohli tried to play Ben Stokes down the leg side in the second T20I, he managed only to edge him for a six over third-man. There are no marks for aesthetics in T20 cricket. A badly struck boundary trumps an elegant shot for a single every time.

Having six-hitters

Four, the emergence of the six-hitters. India are still six-shy relative to the other teams, but the likes of Pant, Kishan, Hardik Pandya, and lower down the order Shardul Thakur hold out promise.

As tactics get more sophisticated, there could be a nominated six-hitter at No. 7 or 8. Fielders won’t matter because the batsmen are aiming to clear everything and everybody. Practising six-hitting is already part of a batsman’s drill. The technique will mature.

When India lost in the semifinals of the 2016 World T20, they had made 192 batting first. The West Indies won in the 20th over, losing just three wickets. The winners struck nearly thrice as many sixes (11 to 4), and that was an important difference. Hitting the ball into the crowd is, to many, the essence of T20 cricket, and the more players in the team who can do that, the better off it is.

Five, and possibly the most important, the introduction of big data which decides everything from player selection to match tactics. Coaches have got better at interpreting the data, and players at understanding them. Kohli’s message acknowledges this.</p></p></p></p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</p></p>Virat Kohli, a role model for the youth</p></p>Defending Champion Mumbai Indians Will Take On Royal Challengers Bangalore In Chennai On April , A Picture Story Of The Various Kits Of Ipl Teams Since , </p></p>Virat Kohli is an inspiration and a role model for the youth today. We have seen his growing maturity, his consistency and his leadership abilities. Despite this, it is fascinating what one can discover when there is a blend of knowledge and sensibilities of a third man’s perspective about the emergent idol. The interaction I had with Chandu Borde at The Poona Club was educational, to say the least.

Borde was one of the finest batsmen of India and has been known to be a shrewd judge of the game. He was also the coach-cum-manager on the tour of England when India won the series.

We discussed the techniques of modern Indian players. As he has batted against top quality international and domestic attack on different surfaces, he made astute observations about the batting styles of Indian batsmen.

He stated that Virat Kohli is the best batsman in the world right now. He reasoned by saying, “Kohli is equally comfortable on backfoot and frontfoot. Regardless of the format, he reads the length, line, spin and swing quicker than most international batsmen and has time to execute stokes. He has the knack of finding gaps in the field and is fit enough to convert a single into twos and twos to threes.”

As a matter of fact, this was Borde’s batting style too. Some old timers say that Borde was not given his due; the selection politics was deeply rooted in Indian cricket back then.

How can one be confident when the chairman of the National Selection Committee flies down to Nagpur during a Duleep Trophy match, assures him the captaincy, asks him to write down 15 names for the West Indies tour of 1971 and when the team is announced, he not only finds out that he isn’t the captain but also he is not even in the team!

It is a blessing that times have changed. Kohli didn’t have to go through all this selection mess.

When questioned about Kohli’s failure in England, Borde said: “How many times did he tour England? Conditions are different and there are times when English batsmen struggle too. A player needs to adapt himself quickly which means he has to spend more time in the nets and in the middle. Kohli is now matured and knows how to adapt to different conditions. Do not expect everyone to bat like Tendulkar.”

Initially, Kohli’s aggression was bordering on indiscipline. It rattled him when certain sections of the media played it up. It was Ravi Shastri, having the experience of bearing the brunt of the media in the eighties, who guided him to keep his focus. Once this aspect was taken care of, we got to watch the revised version of Kohli who got his team members to gel as a family.

Leading from the front

The responsibility of Test captaincy seems to bring the best out of him. Leading from the front is easier said than done. But Kohli seems like a veteran on the field and his tactical moves gladden the hearts of many successful Indian captains.

He manages time to perfection and keeps himself mentally and physically fit to be consistent in all formats of the game. It’s his zone that matters most to him and he has managed to maintain that irrespective of the game situation.

Even Greg Chappell, who scored over 700 runs in a series against the fierce West Indian attack, writes: “Comparing them across Tendulkar’s entire ODI career, Kohli has scored a larger proportion of runs vis-à-vis Tendulkar albeit at a lower Strike Rate Impact, but when it comes to building partnerships, absorbing pressure and chasing, Kohli is ahead of Tendulkar. Kohli appears to be a driven individual so, on the evidence so far, we can look forward to many more match-winning performances and series-defining efforts from him before he has finished.”

I don’t claim to know Kohli as some of the journalists from Delhi do. They have followed his career since his school days. This is very important because one gets to observe the player’s change in attitude or approach over the years. One such man is Vijay Lokapally, whose book “Driven” showcases a man committed to the game.

The 2016-17 period is going to be tough for Kohli. As a captain and a No. 4 batsman, it could be very exhausting. It will be riveting to watch a man of his class tackle this period and emerge successfully.</p></p></p></p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

</p></p>Wisden’s Cricketers Of The Decade: Virat Kohli</p></p></p></p>Taking performances in all three formats into account, Virat Kohli is the standout batsman his generation. The editor of the Wisden Almanack, Lawrence Booth, on one of the cricketers of the decade.

When Virat Kohli arrived in England for the summer of 2018, he bore the kind of burden that would have overwhelmed lesser mortals. On India’s previous visit, four years earlier, they had lost 3-1 and Kohli had averaged 13, maneuvered around the crease – this way and that, hither and thither – by James Anderson and the Dukes. The return leg, then, shaped up as a chance for redemption.

It very nearly didn’t happen. Having moved to 21 in his first innings of the series, at Edgbaston, Kohli fenced at Anderson in time-honoured fashion, apparently unable to resist the width on offer, only for Dawid Malan to grass the chance at second slip. The rest was history. Kohli went on to make 149 out of an Indian total of 274, and followed up with scores of 97 and 103 at Trent Bridge, then 46 and 58 at the Ageas Bowl.

India lost 4–1 – which didn’t remotely reflect the balance of power – but Kohli had ticked the last remaining box on his CV. Even with a first-ball duck in his final innings of the series, at The Oval, he totalled 593 runs – 459 more than he had managed four years earlier. He had now flourished in every conceivable set of conditions around the world. He had become the complete batsman.

It seems hard to imagine now but, for a while, Kohli couldn’t quite crack Test cricket. By the time he had scored his first Test hundred, at Adelaide in January 2012, he had already made eight in one-day internationals, laying down an early marker for what has become a widely accepted truth: Kohli is the best white-ball batsman in the history of the game, especially when India are chasing.

Yet after that England series in 2014, his Test average dropped below 40, and his struggles against the red ball were interpreted in some quarters as a kind of cultural commentary on the state of Indian cricket, a game in thrall to the white ball and razzmatazz, to style above substance.

Kohli’s Decade Tests: 84 (7,202 runs @ 54.97; best: 254*; 27 hundreds)

ODIs: 227 (11,125 runs @ 60.79; best: 183*; 42 hundreds)

T20Is: 75 (2,633 runs @ 52.66; strike-rate: 138.07; best: 94*, 24 fifties)

That reading, though, reckoned without the fundamental drive that informs Kohli’s cricket. In that respect, it’s hard to look beyond the early loss of his father, Prem. The 18-year-old Kohli was 40 not out at stumps on the second day of his fourth-class match for Delhi against Karnataka, when news reached him that Prem had died at the age of 54. After informing the Delhi coach that he wanted to carry on batting next day, “because for me not completing a cricket game is a sin”, he scored 90, helping his side avoid the follow-on.

The anger has never quite left him. Among contemporary cricketers, perhaps only David Warner celebrates his hundreds with the same look of outright fury, as if the world is against him, and he has just proved them all wrong. Critics are divided about what Kohli’s simmering rage denotes: passion or brattishness? Either way, there cannot have been many down the years who have worn their heart so engagingly on their sleeve. Cricket rarely feels more alive than when Kohli is batting, preferably in front of a delirious crowd in India. Like him, or find him mildly irritating, we all owe him a debt.

His genius has been to rise, time and again, to the challenge. Between the end of the England tour in 2014 and the second Test against Bangladesh at Kolkata in November, Kohli averaged 63, with 21 hundreds and 13 fifties. It left him with a unique set of statistics – the only batsman to average at least 50 in all three international formats. Even Steve Smith was moved to remark recently that there is no one quite like him.

In many ways, there isn’t. Since the retirement of Sachin Tendulkar and the gradual waning of MS Dhoni, no cricketer in the world has operated under such daily pressure as Kohli. His marriage to Bollywood star Anushka Sharma has turned up the heat to another level, and Kohli has told the story of a trip to Iceland, where they were enjoying some rare anonymity… only to be recognised by a delighted Indian family in a coffee shop.

Yet, like all the greats, Kohli seems to thrive in the spotlight. He recently became the first player to score 20,000 international runs in a single decade, and appeared to relish every one of them.

Till date, Kohli has 70 international hundreds, which is remarkable enough. Almost as remarkable is his conversion rate: as well as those 70 hundreds, he has a further 101 scores of 50-plus. When Kohli is set, there is no budging him. Bowlers all round the world have come to know the feeling. It will be around for a while yet.

The Match Australia v India

Adelaide, First Test

December 2014

115 & 141 A lot has been talked of that chasing masterpiece in Hobart which perhaps was the first major statement of a great in the making. The second of the twin tons in Adelaide 2014 though, was the one that defined Kohli the leader. Kohli walked into the game as skipper for the first time in whites after MS Dhoni had been sidelined with a thumb injury. Chasing Australia’s first innings declared total of 517-7, Kohli’s fluent 115, which came after a vicious Mitchell Johnson delivery had struck his helmet first ball, kept his team in the hunt. Another challenge awaited India: a 364-run chase on a fifth-day wicket at the Adelaide Oval. Losing two wickets with little on board could have pushed many onto the defensive; not Kohli, who personifies intent. His 185-run association with Murali Vijay had put his team in command, but a stunning collapse in the final session resulted in a 48-run defeat. The skipper however had no regrets on the approach. “We have come here to play positive cricket. No sort of negativity is welcome in this group,” he had said after the game. The first seeds of Kohli’s India, that would become a dominating force in Test cricket five years later were sown on that afternoon in Adelaide. The baton had already been passed, even before he was to become a regular captain three weeks later. By Roshan Gede, wisden.com staff writer
